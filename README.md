# SPV-Panel-Cooling-system

Designed a cooling system to enhance the efficiency of Solar Photovoltaic Panels. The cooling system comprised of a custom designed aluminum casing serving as a thermal conductivity enhancer which had a phase change material (RT-42). To evaluate its effectiveness, the setup was tested under direct sunlight for two hours, and its performance was compared to an uncooled panel under identical conditions. 

The goal was to develop a passive cooling solution that enhances solar panel efficiency by reducing overheating. The experiment yielded an increase in  the conversion efficiency by around 16.5% in the panel with the cooling system.
